# VSCode Custom CSS

This repository documents how to customize the default VSCode appearance using CSS. By default, VSCode enforces its built-in theme, but with the help of an extension, users can apply their own custom styles.

## How to Apply Custom CSS
To apply these custom styles, you need to install and configure the **Enable Custom CSS and JS Loader** extension in VSCode. Follow these steps:

1. Install the extension: **Enable Custom CSS and JS Loader** from the VSCode marketplace.
2. Open VSCode settings and specify the path to your custom CSS file.
3. Run the command `Enable Custom CSS and JS` from the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`).
4. Restart or reload VSCode (`Ctrl+Shift+P` â†’ `Reload Window`).
5. Repeat step 3 and 4 whenever VSCode updates, as updates may reset the applied styles.

## Purpose of This Repository
This repository serves as a reference for users who want to personalize their VSCode interface by modifying:
- Colors
- Fonts
- Layout styles
- Other visual elements
