# CSS Custom for VSCode

This repository serves as documentation for customizing the default VSCode appearance using CSS. By default, VSCode's styling is determined by the built-in theme settings, but users can modify its look and feel according to their preferences. This documentation provides guidance on how to locate, modify, and apply custom CSS to enhance the user interface.

The purpose of this repository is to provide a reference for users who wish to personalize their VSCode environment. It covers essential steps for modifying the interface, including changing colors, adjusting layout styles, and applying custom themes. Users can experiment with different styles to create a more visually appealing and comfortable workspace.

Feedback on the customization process, styling suggestions, or usability improvements is highly appreciated. Contributions such as corrections, additional styling techniques, or enhancements to existing instructions are welcome through pull requests.
